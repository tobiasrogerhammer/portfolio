- Code icon for Java project placeholders
- Special information panel showing complexity and concepts
- Different tag colors for Java projects

## How to Add New Java Projects

### Step 1: Add Project to the projects array

```javascript
{
  id: 9, // Next available ID
  title: "Your Java Project Name",
  description: "Detailed description of what the project does and its features.",
  image: "/api/placeholder/600/400", // or actual image URL
  tags: ["Java", "Spring Boot", "REST API", "Database"],
  category: "java", // Must be "java" for Java projects
  github: "https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo",
  live: "https://your-demo-url.com", // or GitHub repo URL
  complexity: "Intermediate", // Beginner, Intermediate, or Advanced
  concepts: ["Spring Boot", "REST APIs", "JPA", "Security"],
  learningOutcome: "Learned Spring Boot framework and REST API development"
}
```

### Step 2: Update Project Information

Replace the example projects with your actual Java projects:

1. **Blackjack Game** (Beginner) - Update with your actual implementation
2. **Student Management System** (Intermediate) - Replace with your project
3. **Bank Account Simulator** (Advanced) - Replace with your project

### Step 3: Add Real Project Images

- Take screenshots of your Java applications
- Add them to the `public/` folder
- Update the `image` field with the correct path

## Tips for Showcasing Java Projects

1. **Include Screenshots**: Take screenshots of your applications running
2. **Document Learning**: Explain what concepts you learned from each project
3. **Show Progression**: Arrange projects from beginner to advanced
4. **Include Code**: Make sure your GitHub repos are public and well-documented
5. **Add Demos**: If possible, create live demos or video recordings

## Next Steps

1. Replace the example projects with your actual Java projects
2. Add real screenshots to the `public/` folder
3. Update GitHub links to point to your actual repositories
4. Consider adding a "View All Java Projects" button that links to a dedicated Java projects page

Your Java projects will now stand out with their distinctive styling and detailed information, making it easy for visitors to understand your Java learning journey and technical skills!
